#Dimensions for minimum derivatives and position, velocity,  acceleration, 
#etc. are implied by the order of the lists containing values. The first
#entry always corresponds to the first dimension (x), the second to (y), and
#so on. The length of each list must be equal to Dimension in order to be 
#parsed without error.
